\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
The goal of the reflection is to set, evaluate, and adjust the schedule. The reflection also includes an evaluation of the time spend, the work that I have done, and the progress that I have made. I have planned the first evaluation after I have finished the preparation and research planning phases. The second evaluation is planned after the practice presentation, and a third evaluation is planned after the research execution is finished. A final evaluation is planned just before the study is finalized.
